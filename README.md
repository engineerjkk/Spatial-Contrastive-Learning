**Abstract**: *Visual Localization entails estimating the position and orientation of a camera from input images. Since it is pivotal to robotics, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality felds, improvements to its accuracy and computational efciency are vital. Although several approaches to hierarchical visual localization have been proposed, the convolutional operations in their global localization stage infate their computational requirements. This study proposes a hierarchical framework comprised of a multi-modal CrossViT (Vision Transformer) that leverages both image features and 3D spatial information to generate more robust global descriptors. In the contrastive learning approach employed, the positive and negative image sets for each anchor image are designated based on the presence of shared 3D points. The intersection-over-union between 3D bounding boxes generated from a pair of images is used as a quantitative measure of similarity for positive sets in the loss computation. The embedding capacity of the proposed multi-modal CrossViT is transferred onto an architecture that takes a single image as input using a knowledge distillation approach.
Local matching models are used to establish correspondences between the anchor image and each of the retrieved reference images. The fnal camera pose is determined using the random sample consensus and perspective-n-point algorithm. The large-scale Aachen Day-Night datasets were used to evaluate the efciency and accuracy of the proposed approach.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art approaches with signifcantly less processing and memory requirements (58.9 times fewer per-second foating-point operations and 21.6 times fewer parameters than the NetVLAD model).*

- The proposed approach is capable of generating distinct embeddings for scenes that are physically distant from each other even when they have similar visual features. Here, the embeddings of an anchor image (black outline) and its corresponding positive image (red outline) are close to each other in the embedding space but that of the negative image (blue outline) is farther away.

- d_(i,j) represents the Euclidean distance between embedding vectors generated by the proposed multi-modal CrossViT model. w_(i,j) is the degree of proximity between positive image pairs that is expressed as a continuous value ranging from 0 (negative) to 1 (same image). Optimizing this loss results in more similar embeddings for images captured in closer proximity to each other.

- The student model is trained to have an embedding space similar to that of the teacher model. Since the loss function ensures that the representations generated from an anchor and negative image pair are even farther away from each other in the embedding space, the student model generates more robust representations than the teacher model.

### Conclusion
In order to facilitate more robust camera pose estimation, this study proposes a multi-modal CrossViT that leverages both image features and 3D spatial information in generating robust descriptors in the global localization stage of hierarchical visual localization frameworks. Prior to training, the positive and negative image sets for each anchor image are designated based on the presence of shared 3D points. The proposed teacher model was trained using a spatial contrastive loss in which the degree of proximity between anchor and positive images is used as a quantitative measure of similarity. In order to transfer the embedding capacity of this multi-modal architecture to an inference model that only requires a single image input with no 3D spatial information, a Gaussian kernel-based knowledge distillation approach was used. The proposed approach was evaluated on the large-scale Aachen Day-Night and Aachen Day-Night_v1.1 datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach requires significantly less memory and processing power than previous state-of-the-art approaches but achieves comparable performance. More specifically, it achieves accuracies of 87.3%, 95.0%, and 97.6% for daytime cases and 87.8%, 89.8%, and 95.9% for nighttime cases under thresholds of “0.25m, 2°”, “0.5m, 5°” and “5m, 10°” respectively with 58.9 times fewer FLOPs and 21.6 times fewer parameters than the NetVLAD model. As highlighted in Figures 10-12, the proposed approach achieves robust representations containing visual and 3D spatial information across a range of scenes. However, it is unable to generate sufficiently robust embeddings for scenes that occur only once or twice in the imbalanced training dataset. In order to address this, we intend to constitute and pre-train with significantly larger datasets that are suitable for SfM reconstruction. Weighting coefficients are to be used to further emphasize the impact of anchor images with smaller positive sets during training. Hard negative sampling techniques that consider both spatial proximity and visual similarity are also to be leveraged in improving recall performance.
